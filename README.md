# Enophone Music Experiment

This project is designed to conduct experiments using the Enophone headset to record EEG signals while subjects listen to music. The program streams and records EEG data, displays it in real-time, and manages experimental protocols including displaying messages and playing songs. The project was performed by Anestopoulos K. and Patsakos G., under the supervision of Associate Prof. Athanasios Koutras.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- BrainFlow
- PyQt5
- pyqtgraph
- pygame
- numpy
- pandas
- mne

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the experiment, run the following command:

```bash
python binaural_experiment.py --mac-address <MAC_ADDRESS> --subject <SUBJECT_ID>
```

Replace `<MAC_ADDRESS>` with the MAC address of your Enophone headset and `<SUBJECT_ID>` with the identifier for the subject.

### Quitting the Program

You can quit the program at any time by pressing the `q` key (to be updated soon).

## Experiment Protocol

1. **Initial Relaxation with Eyes Closed (1 minute):**
   - The subject sits with eyes closed.
   - A message is displayed indicating the start and end of this period.
   - Marker 1 is inserted at the start and marker 2 at the end.

2. **Music Listening Session:**
   - The subject listens to a 30-second segment of a song.
   - A message indicating the song number is displayed.
   - Marker 3 is inserted at the start and marker 4 at the end.
   - After the song, the subject relaxes for 10 seconds before the next song.
   - Marker 1 is inserted at the start and marker 2 at the end of the relaxation period.
   - This process is repeated for 5 songs in total.

3. **End of Experiment:**
   - Marker 6 is inserted at the end of the experiment.

## Data Saving

Data is saved in two formats:

1. **CSV File:**
   - EEG data, timestamps, and markers are saved in a CSV file named `<SUBJECT_ID>_eeg_data.csv`.

2. **MNE FIF File:**
   - Data is also saved in MNE's FIF format for further analysis, named `<SUBJECT_ID>_eeg_data.raw.fif`.
